                            The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents
                            designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as
                            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

                            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the
                            documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically
                            and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

                            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other
                            objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a
                            means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as
                            headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by
                            tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <(img /)> and <(input /)> directly
                                    introduce content into the page.
                                    Other tags such as <(p)> surround and provide information about document text and
                                        may include other
                                        tags as
                                        sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret
                                        the content
                                        of the page.

                                        HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript,
                                        which affects
                                        the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and
                                        layout of
                                        content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and
                                        current
                                        maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit
                                        presentational
                                        HTML since 1997. A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and
                                        audio,
                                        primarily using the <(canvas)> element, in collaboration with javascript.

                            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation
                            of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology
                            of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

                            CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout,
                            colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more
                            flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable
                            multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css
                            file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css
                            file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and
                            its formatting.

                            Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page
                            in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice
                            (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also
                            has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.

                            The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule
                            applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme
                            is predictable.

                            The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media
                            type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C
                            operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.

                            In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain
                            XML, SVG, and XUL.

                            JavaScript often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is
                            one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Over 97% of
                            websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating
                            third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to
                            execute the code on users' devices.

                            JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the
                            ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and
                            first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and
                            imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working
                            with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object
                            Model (DOM).

                            The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking,
                            storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system
                            provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

                            JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of
                            some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage
                            is Node.js.

                            Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries,
                            the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.

                            It took me a long time to understand what the terms programming and coding really
                            meant, and what each field entailed. And I'm sure I'm not the only one who felt confused by
                            those two terms when I was new to tech.
                            For a while I thought that they were the same thing, and it took me some time to understand
                            that there are differences between the two "worlds".

                            In this article, I'll explain the basic differences between coding and programming and how
                            they work collaboratively to develop apps and sites.

                            So let’s explore these terms and how professionals use them by first understanding what they
                            mean.

                            <b>Codding</b>
                            You might have seen courses, bootcamps, or articles talk all about coding – so why is the
                            emphasis on this term?

                            This is because the actual act of coding makes it possible for us to do all the cool stuff
                            we do
                            every day. It lets us use mobile apps, work with different software and operating systems,
                            and
                            even play the games we love or visit the website you are reading this article on. It's all
                            made
                            possible through coding.

                            So, what is coding in simple terms?

                            We can define coding as the act of translating instructions for a computer from human
                            language
                            to a language a machine can understand. This code tells the computer how to behave and what
                            actions to perform.

                            If you want to become a coder, you'll need to have some basic knowledge about programming
                            language(s). When I say programming languages, I mean languages like: Python, Java, Go, PHP,
                            or
                            JavaScript, just to mention a few.

                            <b>Programing</b>
                            You've probably also heard people say, "I am a programmer". And some of them who use this
                            term
                            have an understanding of what the terms means while other don't. If you don't know what
                            exactly
                            programming means, let's try and shed some light by understanding what programming is all
                            about.

                            Programming is the process of creating the instructions that will tell the computer how to
                            perform a particular task given to it. You do this using programming languages like:

                            Programming languages

                            When we talk about programming, think of something like a remote control for your TV – it
                            will
                            wait for you to give it instructions by pressing different buttons which then tell the TV to
                            perform a specific task (like changing the channel, increasing the volume, and so on). Well,
                            this is the same way programmers can instruct a computer to do various things.

                            With programming, you can almost do anything – like programming robots to help with house
                            chores, or even programming self-driven cars like Tesla.

                            In order for a programmer to develop a program that will implement their idea, they need to
                            carry out the following steps:

                            Planning the structure of the app (with the help of tools like Trello)
                            Designing it (by using tools like Figma or Adobexd)
                            Developing it (by using their programming language of choice)
                            Testing its features
                            Deploying it (on either free or paid hosting services)
                            Maintaining it after it's finished.
                            So as you can see, we can say that programming does not only deal with the actual writing of
                            the
                            code. It also involves using data structures and algorithms, and in general dealing with the
                            bigger picture of creating and developing complex systems.

                            <b>The Difference between Coding and Programming</b>
                            We will divide the differences in four main categories which will help us break down the
                            concepts and understand them better.

                            The terminology
                            Coding deals with writing code in a language understood by both machines and humans. The
                            main
                            aim of coding is to provide communication between the two (humans & computers).

                            Programming involves creating an outline and structure for the program’s code that follows
                            certain standards, before the actual code is written to preform the task it needs to
                            perform.

                            The tools you use
                            When it comes to coding, one of your most important tools will be your text editor (like
                            Notepad, or something more complex and feature-rich like Visual Studio Code, Sublime, Atom,
                            or
                            Vim).

                            When you're talking about Programming, on the other hand, you'll need some additional tools.
                            As
                            a programmer, you'll be performing document reviews, doing lots of planning, thinking about
                            design, and so on.

                            To help you with these tasks, you'll use tools like more advanced code editors, analysis
                            tools,
                            debuggers, modelling frameworks, assemblers, modelling algorithms and more.

                            As a programmer you will need to have a lot of experience using these tools and more
                            exposure to
                            the processes that developers use to build apps and other products.

                            Your Level of knowledge
                            As a coder having basic knowledge of a programming language and its syntax is a good start.
                            Once
                            you know how to code in one language, it's easier to learn others. And again, your main
                            purpose
                            is on writing the actual code that tells the machine what to do.

                            On the other hand programmers need more knowledge to begin with. You'll need to know how to
                            create and work with algorithms, how to design websites, how to debug and test your code,
                            how to
                            manage projects, and of course how to work with programming languages.

                            Problem solving, critical thinking and analytical skills are also essential when you're
                            developing complex systems.

                            The end product
                            As a coder your expected outcome is typically a simple solution that, after compiling, will
                            successfully give your desired output. A good example is the one we gave earlier –
                            converting a
                            PDF into an audio file.

                            On the other hand a programmers will work to give a whole working application or piece of
                            software that people will use in the market. They're also responsible for following up and
                            maintaining what they build to ensure it's running smoothly without any glitches.

                            <b>How Coding and Programming Work Together</b>
                            By this point I hope you are able to tell the difference between coding and programming and
                            what
                            the two deal with. Now, let's see how the two can (and should) work closely together to
                            accomplish a lot.

                            To better understand the how, let's begin by providing a real scenario where both coding and
                            programming will be required to work closely to produce a complete working app.

                            Imagine you have been asked to create an app that will help monitor or keep track of your
                            daily
                            routine or monitor your daily expenses. By using the concepts of the two worlds this is how
                            you
                            will accomplish the task.

                            You will need a programmer, who will be able to:

                            plan the structure of the app (with the help of tools like Trello)
                            Write down the main features of the app, what users are expected to use it for, etc
                            Design the app (by using tools like Figma or Adobexd)
                            After completing these steps, the coder's role comes in play. They take the ideas the
                            programmer
                            creates and transform it into a machine-readable form by writing code to perform the tasks
                            specified. After the magical process of coding, the programmer comes back in play.

                            The programmer will then asses the code and check for errors, run tests and check that
                            everything is working correctly and that the code gives the expected result. If all this
                            checks,
                            the application is now ready for deployment and maintenance – which remains in the hands of
                            the
                            programmer.

                            This simple example explains how the two skills can be used together for productivity.

                            And just a final point: a "coder" and a "programmer" aren't always two separate people. They
                            can
                            be one and the same person who performs all these tasks.

                            Wrap Up
                            Where do you belong in the two worlds? It took me time to figure out what am really
                            interested
                            in.

                            If you are more interested in logic, trying putting your energy into the whole process of
                            programming. If you really just enjoy reading and writing code, then invest your time in
                            coding.

                            As we know, computer science is a very wide field and it is still evolving. Work on finding
                            the
                            path you want to explore and focusing on it – just make sure to enjoy it and have fun, too.

                            maintained by a community of volunteers through a model of open collaboration, using a
                            wiki-based editing system. Individual contributors, also called editors, are known as
                            Wikipedians. It is the largest and most-read reference work in history. It is
                            consistently one of the 15 most popular websites ranked by Alexa; as of 2021, Wikipedia was
                            ranked the 13th most popular site. It is hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, an
                            American non-profit organization funded mainly through donations.

                            On January 15, 2001, Jimmy Wales[6] and Larry Sanger launched Wikipedia; Sanger coined its
                            name as a portmanteau of "wiki" and "encyclopedia." Wales was influenced by the
                            "spontaneous order" ideas associated with Friedrich Hayek and the Austrian School of
                            economics, after being exposed to these ideas by Austrian economist and Mises Institute
                            Senior Fellow Mark Thornton. Initially available only in English, versions in other
                            languages were quickly developed. Its combined editions comprise more than 58 million
                            articles, attracting around 2 billion unique device visits per month and more than 17
                            million edits per month (1.9 edits per second) as of November 2020. In 2006, Time
                            magazine stated that the policy of allowing anyone to edit had made Wikipedia the "biggest
                            (and perhaps best) encyclopedia in the world."

                            Wikipedia has received praise for its enablement of the democratization of knowledge, extent
                            of coverage, unique structure, culture, and reduced amount of commercial bias, but criticism
                            for exhibiting systemic bias, particularly gender bias against women and alleged ideological
                            bias. Its reliability was frequently criticized in the 2000s but has improved over
                            time; it has been generally praised in the late 2010s and early 2020s. Its
                            coverage of controversial topics such as American politics and major events such as the
                            COVID-19 pandemic has received substantial media attention. It has been censored by world
                            governments, ranging from specific pages to the entire site. Nevertheless, it has become an
                            element of popular culture, with references in books, films, and academic studies. In April
                            2018, Facebook and YouTube announced that they would help users detect fake news by
                            suggesting fact-checking links to related Wikipedia articles.
